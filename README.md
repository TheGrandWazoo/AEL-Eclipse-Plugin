AEL-Eclipse-Plugin
==================

A plugin to Eclipse for AEL (Asterisk Extension Langange).

The plugin is under development, so be gentle.

It provides the following...<br>
	* Application name highlighting<<br>
	* Function name highlighting<br>
	* Code block rollup<br>
	* Comment rollup<br>
	* Use /** for documention highlighting (like DoxyGen)<br>

Currently, place the ael.xml file in the user directory.  This contains application
and function name for highlighting.

Working on providing a downloadable jar file to place in the dropins directory
of Eclipse.  Might need to do this at an external site.
